                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today is my birthday. I am now 22 years old. At this age Walt Disney started <i>Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio</i> with his brother, 
                    which later went on to become <i>Walt Disney Studios</i>. Charles Darwin at 22 set set off as ship's naturalist on a voyage to South America 
                    and the Galapagos Islands. Here I am writing about me. I don't mean to be <i>this</i> way right now, perhaps its 
                    the mood you get when you think about <i>everything</i> at the end of the year. You get it, right?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My birthday falls on a very special day, and people never fail to raise their eye brows when they hear it. But the 
                    the truth is I can't compete with New Years Eve, so people often forget my birthday sometimes. It never did bother me, 
                    but in 2016 my friends had a suprise party for me. I never had so much fun on my birthday. I am grateful for that moment, 
                    and every birthday after only makes me treasure that moment more. If you're wondering what happened after 2016, friends 
                    got busy with New Years Eve.

                    2017 was a troubling year. I couldn't get a 2 month internship and after that I didn't get through any interviews for 
                    a full time job. In the end of the semester my elder brother forwared my resume to his Professor in KAUST. He liked my resume 
                    and now I'll be working on a deep learning project under him for 6 months. It did work out well for me but I am still uncertain 
                    about my future full time job. I also realised how important and useful networking is in the real world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today I realised how merciless time can be. The only person who I thought understood me was my highschool best friend, we drifted away 
                    when we entered university. I remember how inseperable we were in school, the secrets we shared and the hours we spent laughing. 
                    We used to talk for hours on the telephone. We discussed ideas, plans to change the world. We felt immortal. I guess thinking back everyone 
                    felt this way in highschool. But now in the present, we don't even message one another. He didn't wish me on my birthday this year and I think I wished him, or did I? 
                    I don't remember...
                    <br>
                    <i>
                        A friend so dear with so many promises, only to be forgoten in the passing of time.
                        <br> 
                        So cruel, merciless is Time. Smirking at this irony.
                    </i>
                    <br>
                    I have a dear friend in university but our engineering lives prevented us from being close. And after 
                    a semester we graduate. Part ways. I hope to not repeat my mistake. I will put more effort and give my time to keep this going. 
                    Never take true friendship for granted, it is as rare as a pearl in the ocean.

                    I want 2018 to be different for me. I am going to make it better for me. I want to be a data scientist. The 
                    internship I have is an amazing start for me. I am going to start a data science YouTube channel, like Vsauce 
                    but all about data. But to have a meaningful new years resolution, you must make it quantifiable. A resolution such 
                    as, "I will lose weight" can be completed by skipping a meal for a week. "I will lose 20kg", is a better resolution. 
                    It's easier to track progress and more motivating seeing that number go down. My new years resolution is to 
                    work on 100 datasets and make a video on each one. This will be the #100datasetchallenge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I will follow up to this on December 31st, 2018. Will I achieve my resolution? Will I live on that long?
                    Stay tuned for the next episode of <b>Quatervois</b>!
